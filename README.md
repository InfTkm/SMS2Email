# SMStoEmail
I have a SIM card from another country used solely as a verification code receiver.  
Unfortunately, my primary phone doesn't support dual sim.  
So I make this app installed in a backup phone and it will forward text messages to my email.  
There are solutions in the Play Store, but often fail, so I need to build one for myself. 
A simple one.
